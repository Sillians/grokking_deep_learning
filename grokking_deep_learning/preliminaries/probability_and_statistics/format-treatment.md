### **Sample Space, Events, and Randomness — Explained Concisely**

When randomness is involved (like flipping a coin or rolling a die), we describe all possible outcomes using a set called the **sample space**.

---

### **1. Sample Space (Ω)**

The **sample space** is the set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment.

| Experiment             | Sample Space (Ω)                     |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Flip one coin          | Ω = {Heads, Tails}                   |
| Roll one six-sided die | Ω = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}               |
| Flip two coins         | Ω = {(H, H), (H, T), (T, H), (T, T)} |

---

### **2. Events**

An **event** is any subset of the sample space — a group of outcomes we're interested in.

#### Example: Flip two coins

* Ω = {(H, H), (H, T), (T, H), (T, T)}
* Event A: “First coin is heads”
  → A = {(H, H), (H, T)}
* If the outcome is (H, H), then **A occurred**.

---

### **3. Dice Example**

Let’s define:

* Ω = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
* Event B: “See a 1” → B = {1}
* Event C: “See an odd number” → C = {1, 3, 5}

#### Outcome: 1

* B occurred (since 1 ∈ B)
* C occurred (since 1 ∈ C)

#### Outcome: 3

* B did **not** occur (3 ∉ B)
* C occurred (3 ∈ C)

### **Summary**

| Term             | Definition                  |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- |
| Sample space (Ω) | All possible outcomes       |
| Outcome (ω)      | A single realization from Ω |
| Event (A)        | A subset of Ω               |
| Occurrence       | Event A occurs if ω ∈ A     |
