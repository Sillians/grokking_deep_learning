## Calculus

**Differential calculus** enables deep learning models to learn by computing **gradients**, the rate of 
change of loss with respect to model parametersâ€”through techniques like **backpropagation**. 
These gradients guide the optimization process during training. 

Optimization addresses how to fit our models to training data, and calculus is its key prerequisite. 
However, do not forget that our ultimate goal is to perform well on previously unseen data. 
That problem is called generalization and will be a key focus of other chapters.
