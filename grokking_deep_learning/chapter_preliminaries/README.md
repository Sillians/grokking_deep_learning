## Preliminaries

#### Here are some essential survival skills worth knowing:

1. techniques for storing and manipulating data; 
2. libraries for ingesting and preprocessing data from a variety of sources; 
3. knowledge of the basic `linear algebraic` operations that we apply to high-dimensional data elements; 
4. just enough `calculus` to determine which direction to adjust each parameter in order to decrease the loss function; 
5. the ability to automatically compute `derivatives` so that you can forget much of the calculus you just learned; 
6. some basic fluency in `probability`, our primary language for reasoning under uncertainty;
