### **Forward vs Backward Differentiation**

Choosing **forward** or **backward (reverse-mode)** automatic differentiation depends on the **structure of the function**, 
particularly the **dimensions of input and output** and **computational efficiency**.

###  **1. Forward Differentiation**

* **Mechanism:** Propagates derivatives from inputs to outputs.
* **Computational Cost:** Proportional to the number of **inputs**.
* **Good for:** Functions with **few inputs and many outputs**.

####  Use Forward Mode When:

| Scenario                                            | Why Forward Mode is Efficient                           |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Input dimension **small** (e.g. scalar input)       | Only a few directional derivatives to compute           |
| You need derivatives **w\.r.t. specific variables** | It’s direct and memory-efficient                        |
| Evaluating **Jacobian-vector products** (JVPs)      | Forward mode naturally computes them                    |
| Good **parallelization** at early stages            | Independent branches of computation fan out from inputs |

###  **2. Backward Differentiation (Reverse Mode)**

* **Mechanism:** First computes function value, then propagates derivatives from outputs back to inputs.
* **Computational Cost:** Proportional to the number of **outputs**.
* **Good for:** Functions with **many inputs and few outputs** (especially scalar output).

####  Use Backward Mode When:

| Scenario                                                  | Why Reverse Mode is Efficient                                    |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Output dimension **small** (e.g. scalar loss in ML)       | One backward pass computes full gradient efficiently             |
| Input dimension **large** (e.g. high-dimensional weights) | All partial derivatives w\.r.t. inputs are computed in one sweep |
| Evaluating **vector-Jacobian products** (VJPs)            | Backward mode directly computes them                             |
| Needed in **deep learning & optimization**                | Neural networks usually have many parameters and scalar loss     |

| Derivative direction  | Input → Output                | Output → Input                     |
| Cost proportional to  | Number of **inputs**          | Number of **outputs**              |
| Memory usage          | Lower                         | Higher (needs intermediate values) |
| Parallelism advantage | Early stages                  | Later stages                       |

### Summary

* **Use forward mode** when: number of **inputs is small**, or you're computing **directional derivatives**.
* **Use backward mode** when: number of **outputs is small** (especially scalar) and **inputs are many**—typical in training neural networks.
